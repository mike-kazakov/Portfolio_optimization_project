# Portfolio_optimization_project
University project on analyzing stock returns of US healthcare companies and building optimal portfolio of these stocks
## Instructions ##
- To run the code, you must save all files from the Data folder in the default working directory.
- If you want to change any parameters in the model (start and end dates for instance), please, in data_project.R run everything before line 239, then run optimization.R, and then run the rest of data_project.R. Since optimization task requires some time to compute, I saved the code for optimization in a separate file and uploaded sims.csv with results of the optimization task to Data folder.
