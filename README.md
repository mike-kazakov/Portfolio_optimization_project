# Portfolio_optimization_project
University project on analyzing stock returns of US healthcare companies and building optimal portfolio of these stocks
## Instructions ##
To run the code you need to store all files from Data folder in your default working directory.

If you want to change any parameters in the model (start and end dates for instance), please, in data_project.R run everything before line 239, then run optimization.R, and then run the rest of data_project.R. Since optimization task requires some time to compute, I saved the code for optimization in a separate file and uploaded sims.csv with results of the optimization task in Data folder.
