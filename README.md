# Portfolio_optimization_project
University project on analyzing stock returns of US healthcare companies and building optimal portfolio of these stocks
## Instructions ##
- To run the code, you must save all files from the Data folder in the default working directory.
- If you want to change any parameters in the model (e.g. start and end dates), please run everything up to line 239 in data_project.R, then run optimization.R, and then run the rest of data_project.R. Since the optimization task requires some computation time, I saved the code for the optimization in a separate file and uploaded sims.csv with the results of the optimization task to the Data folder.
